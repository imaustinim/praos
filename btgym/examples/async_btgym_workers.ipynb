    "- This example shows base setup for asynchronious execution of multiply BTgym environment instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main idea is to utilize separate BTgymDataFeedServer process to draw random episode data samples from one main dataset and pass it to every running environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is quite a memory saver since every env. instance holds only small piece of data (single episode). Besides, sampling and dataset management is performed in it's own process."
